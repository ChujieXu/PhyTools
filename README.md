# PhyTools
This project aims to provide convenient Physics embedding tools for researchers who focus on physical-informed Machine Learning, and support three physical information embedding methods: model-embedding, loss-embedding, and input-embedding, including the implementation of PDENet, DeepONet, FNO, DeepMod, ODE, PINN and other codes.
