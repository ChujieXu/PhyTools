Existing works classify physical priori knowledge(PPK) in various ways. Hao et al. considered the strength level of knowledge constraints, dividing physical priori knowledge into three categories: PDEs/ODEs/SDEs or algebraic constraint, symmetry constraints, and intuitive physical constraints. Meng et al. discussed physical priori knowledge from four perspectives: 1) Classical Mechanics and Energy Conservation Laws, 2) Symmetry, Invariant and Equivariant Functions, 3) Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), 4) Koopman Theory.
